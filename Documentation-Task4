# Task4 DevOps Git Project

A **full Git workflow** from scratch, including branches, commits, files, `.gitignore`, and tags.


1. **Initialized a Git repository**
   - Created a local Git repo using `git init`.

2. **Added a README.md**
   - Added a simple README describing the project.
   - Committed it to Git.

3. **Renamed the default branch to `main`**
   - Ensured GitHub compatibility.

4. **Pushed the main branch to GitHub**
   - Connected local repo to GitHub remote.
   - Used `git push -u origin main`.

5. **Created additional branches**
   - `dev` branch for development.
   - `feature-1` branch for new features.
   - Pushed both branches to GitHub.

6. **Created a `.gitignore` file**
   - Ignored unnecessary files like logs, temp files, `node_modules`, and `.env`.

7. **Added TASKS.md**
   - Documented all tasks we did step by step.

8. **Created a Git tag**
   - Tagged version `v1.0` to mark the milestone.
